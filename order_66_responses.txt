"There's been a rebellion. Don't worry. The situation is under control." -Appo
"I was here on Coruscant. Did my partâ€”all the clones did. Shut those Jedi agitators down cold." -Commander Fox

"username, you're in violation of Order 66. I accuse you of treason against the Grand Army of the Republic." -Jesse
"We know username is on board. They've been marked for termination by Order 66. Under this directive, any and all Jedi leadership must be executed for treason against the Republic. Any soldier who does not comply with the order, will also be executed for treason." -Captain Rex
"I hesitated for a moment when I received Order 66 because the last thing I expected was a Jedi coup. Did I feel betrayed? You bet I did. I thought of all my men who died under Ki-Adi-Mundi's command, and if I'd known then that he and his buddies were gearing up to do the Separatists' work for them and overthrow the government, I'd have shot him as a traitor a lot earlier. He betrayed the trust of every one of us." -Commander Bacara
